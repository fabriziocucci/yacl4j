# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/fabriziocucci/yacl4j/compare/yacl4j-0.6.0...HEAD)
### Changed
- Repackaged Jackson-related dependencies

## [0.6.0](https://github.com/fabriziocucci/yacl4j/compare/yacl4j-0.5.0...yacl4j-0.6.0)
### Changed
- Empty files are treated as empty configurations.

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/fabriziocucci/yacl4j/compare/yacl4j-0.4.0...yacl4j-0.5.0)
### Added
- Introduced http module.

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/fabriziocucci/yacl4j/compare/yacl4j-0.3.0...yacl4j-0.4.0)
### Changed
- Aligned ConfigurationSource for environment variables to the one for system properties, i.e. environment variables specified as json pointers are interpreted as such. 
- The FileConfigurationSource is now based on the InputStream abstraction. The only visible side effect of this change is the possibility to load configuration files embedded in some other jar on the classpath.

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/fabriziocucci/yacl4j/compare/yacl4j-0.2.0...yacl4j-0.3.0)
### Added
- Introduced ConfigurationSource for json-based configurations.

### Changed
- Re-thought '.' character handling in case of Java Properties. This impacts the way in which properties are added to the configuration tree and the way in which placeholders need to be specified in order to be correctly resolved.

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/fabriziocucci/yacl4j/compare/yacl4j-0.0.1...yacl4j-0.1.0)
### Added
